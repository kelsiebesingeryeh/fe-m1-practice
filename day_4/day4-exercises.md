# Day 4 Questions  

## Chapter 5

**1. In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?**  

The "alt" attribute is important because it provides a text description of what the image is if the user cannot see it. It is helpful for screen reader software used by visual impairments and search engines.   

**2.  What determines if an image element is inline or block?**  

If it appears on a new line or not. Block images elements will always appear on a new line. Inline image elements will sit within a block level element and do not sit on a new line. The image will "flow" around the text or other inline elements.

**3.  What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?**  

JPG images are good to use when there are many different colors in a picture. PNG iamges are good to use when there are very few colors or large areas of the same color.   

## Chapter 16

**1.  What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?**  

It helps pages load more smoothly because the code will often load before the images telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download. Also, if you are using images consistently across a site, you can use CSS to control the dimensions of the images.

**2.  What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?**  

A sprite is when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface. The advantage of using sprites is that the web browser only needs to request one image rather than many images, which can make the web page load faster.
