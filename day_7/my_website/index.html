    <br><p> Hi! My name is Kelsie Besinger Yeh and I've been a vegetarian for the last 15+ years! Recently my husband and I have gotten into plant-based recipes and cooking vegan meals.
  We both love the feeling of eating healthy and also helping the environment. We have a lot of fun coming up with recipes and following vegan bloggers.
  Vegan food is really fun to explore and super delicious!</p>

      <p> Most people assume eating plant-based means only eating salads, however this is definitely NOT TRUE!
  I am guilty of eating comfort food and and have listed below my favorite "veganized" comfort food meals.</p>

    <h2>Denver Vegan Food Guide</h2>
      <div class ="P2">
      <p> Moving to Denver from NYC was definitely a lifestyle adjustment, but the saddest part of leaving was the food scene!
  There were so many vegan options in New York, however there are quite a few great vegan options here in Denver.
  I've listed below my favorite restaurants with vegan options!</p>
       <ul class="list">
        <li><a href = "https://www.watercoursefoods.com/" class="list-item">Watercourse Foods (100% vegan)</a></li>
        <li><a href = "http://www.vitalrootdenver.com/home-2-2-2/" class="list-item">Vital Root (99% vegan)</a></li>
        <li><a href = "https://www.nativefoods.com/" class="list-item">Native Foods (100% vegan)</a></li>
