# Day 1

1. **On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?**  

HTML code tells the browser what to read and then interprets the code to create the page the user sees.

2.  **What is the difference between an element and a tag?**  

Elements are made up of two tags (an opening tag and a closing tag). HTML elements tell the browser to read whatever is in between the opening tag and closing tag. Elements make up the HTML code, while the tags are like containers in the elements.

3.  **Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?**  

They provide additional information about the contents of the element. They are made up of two parts - name and a value.

4.  **Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.**  

* Head: This element contains information about the page. This does not show on the browser.
* Title: This element contains a title which is shown in the top of the browser or on the tab of the page. This is usually a short one line title describing the page.
* Body: This element contains the "meat" of the website. Anything contained in the body element will be shown inside the main browser.

5.  **In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?**  

* Go to the website where you want to view the source code.
* Right click and there should be a dropdown on the right side.
* Select "inspect".
* Go to the elements tab in the inspector.
* View code.

6.  **List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.**  

* <body></body> is a body element, it is used to contain information we want the browser to show.
* <head></head> is a head element, it is used to contain information about the page (things we don't want the browser to show).
* <title></title> is a title element, it is used to contain the title of the page, shown in the tab for that page or at the top of the browser.
* <h1></h1> is a header element, it is used to represent the main heading of the page.
* <html></html> is an HTML element, it is used to indicate that anything between the tags is HTML code.

7.  **What are empty elements?**  

Elements that don't require any words between the opening and closing tag. These elements also usually only have one tag (like a break element).

8.  **What is semantic markup?**  

Text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of the page, but adds extra information. These elements help search engines screen for additional information.

9.  **What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.**  

* <nav></nav> is a navigation element used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as primary site navigation.
* <article></article> is an article element used as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone.
* <aside></aside> is an aside element used for two different purposes. If its placed within an article, it contains information that is related to the article, like a glossary. When its used outside of an article element, it acts as a container for content related to the entire page. It might contain links to other sections of the site, a list of recent posts or a search box.
