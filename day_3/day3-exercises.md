# Day 3 Questions

**1.  If you're using an input element in a form, what attribute controls the behavior of that input?**  

The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input will be created.

**2.  What element is used to create a dropdown list?**    

The select element is used to create a drop down list box. It contains two or more elements.

**3.  If you're using an input element to send form data to a server, what should the `type` attribute be set to?**  

Submit. The submit button is used to send a form to the server.

**4.  What element is used to group similar form items together?**  

The fieldset element.   



**1.  Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.**  

* Border - Every box has a border. The border separates the edge of one box from another.
* Margin - Margins sit on the outside edge of the border.
* Padding - Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.

**2.  For a CSS rule `padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px`, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?**  

padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left

**3.  Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.**  

Block-level elements will always start on a new line in the browser window. Inline elements will appear to continue on the same line as the neighboring elements - they flow between surrounding text.

Ex: If we have an unordered list, a block element would show it as a vertical bulleted list. If we change it to inline then the list would appear on the same line (horizontally).

**4.  What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?**  

Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed. When a user scrolls down a page, it stays in the exact same place.  Z-index is important because boxes can overlap depending on what type of positioning you have and Z-index can help control which element sits on top. The z-index value is a number, and the higher the number, the closer that element is to the front.

**5.  What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?**  

Fixed layouts do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Liquid layouts stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
